### Setup up NXT env with USD

Making a nxt.sh for linux:
```
#!/usr/bin/bash

# PATH TO USD
export PYTHONPATH="$PYTHONPATH:PATH/TO/USD/lib/python"
export PATH="$PATH:PATH/TO/USD/bin"
export LD_LIBRARY_PATH="$LD_LIBRARY_PATH:PATH/TO/USD/lib"
# NXT ROOTS
export NXT_FILE_ROOTS="/path/too/work/space"
# Run NXT
nxt ui
```

This can now be run in terminal: ``` ./nxt.sh ```

For windows I add my usds paths to my windows path and pythonpath as instructed, then it to work as expected.
